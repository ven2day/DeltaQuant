"""
Runtime learning feedback.

Closes the learn-from-losses loop at trade-close time: turn a just-closed position into a
TradeOutcome, classify it into a lesson, and store it; and mark the lessons that were active
when the trade was opened as successful/unsuccessful based on the result.

The audit found the analyzer/classifier/injector existed but were never called at runtime —
these helpers are the missing wiring. They are failure-isolated: a learning error must never
disrupt trading.
