"""
Market time helpers.

NSE operates in India Standard Time (IST). IST is a fixed UTC+05:30 offset with
no daylight-saving transitions, so a fixed ``timezone`` is exactly correct and
avoids depending on the system tz database (which is absent on Windows).

Using these helpers everywhere market-hour decisions are made guarantees the same
behaviour regardless of the host's local timezone (e.g. a UTC cloud server or CI
runner) — previously ``datetime.now()`` was compared against IST constants, which
was wrong by the host's UTC offset.
