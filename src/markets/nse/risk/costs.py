"""
Trading cost model for the paper engine.

Models adverse slippage and NSE-style charges so paper P&L reflects what a live account
would actually keep (net of costs) rather than the unrealistically optimistic
fill-at-screen-price, zero-fee result. Values are configurable approximations of a typical
discount-broker NSE equity cost stack — they are intentionally simple and overridable, not a
regulatory-grade calculation.
